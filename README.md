# Easton White's tenure dossier

In the spirit of transparency and openness, this repository contains file related to my tenure packet (which I submitted in May 2025). I describe a few lessons I wish I knew earlier about the tenure process here: https://eastonwhite.substack.com/p/newpi-building-your-tenure-case.

I've included most of my tenure package in this repository. In a few cases, such as reviews from my chair/dean and student comments on courses, I've decided not to make those public. At my university, we place documents within a folder structure as opposed to compiling a single document.
